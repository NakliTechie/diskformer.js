// Unit test for moe-expert-stream.js with a fake GPU queue and a fake OPFS reader:
// residency, LRU eviction order, pins (a prefetch never evicts a slot the current layer holds),
// late hits on in-flight loads, and the bytes that land in each pool part — once through the
// mapped staging ring (the default upload path) and once through queue.writeBuffer.
